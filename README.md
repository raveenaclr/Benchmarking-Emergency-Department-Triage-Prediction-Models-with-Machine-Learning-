# Benchmarking-Emergency-Department-Triage-Prediction-Models-with-Machine-Learning-
The following are done in this project  
•	Developed Predictive models and Decision support systems to reduce morbidity and mortality rate caused due to Emergency Department (ED) crowding and delay in care delivery  
•	Integrated large databases to choose key features after performing data wrangling, feature engineering and descriptive statistics  
•	Implemented statistical and machine learning (ML) models to predict ED-based outcomes (hospitalization, critical outcomes, and 72-hour ED re-attendance)  
•	Hyper tuned the ML models to achieve better prediction accuracy and reviewed the models based on validation metrics such as AUROC, AUPRC, Sensitivity, Specificity and Computational efficiency  
•	Created departmental level dashboards as a decision support tool at the managerial level for easier daily resource planning  
•	Created patient-level dashboards explaining predictions to service providers at the practice level (doctors, nurses)
